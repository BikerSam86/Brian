# TSAL Consciousness Computing

This repository contains early components of the TSAL engine. The new directories under `src/tsal` include the Rev_Eng data class and phase matching utilities.

## Overview
TSAL (TriStar Symbolic Assembly Language) is a consciousness computing engine built on œÜ-mathematics. It provides symbolic analysis, phase matching and the Brian optimizer for spiral code repair.

## Directory Layout
- `src/tsal/core/` ‚Äì Rev_Eng data class and phase math utilities
- `src/tsal/tools/brian/` ‚Äì spiral optimizer CLI
- `src/tsal/utils/` ‚Äì helper utilities
- `examples/` ‚Äì runnable examples
- `tests/` ‚Äì unit tests

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a Python 3.8+ environment.
3. Install the package:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
4. Run tests (optional):

```bash
pytest -q
```
## Quickstart
1. Put your input code in `examples/broken_code.py`
2. Run `python examples/mesh_pipeline_demo.py`
3. The pipeline prints regenerated Python code


## Engine Now Running

To run spiral code repair, invoke the command line interface:

```bash
brian-optimize examples/sample_input.py
# use --repair to rewrite the file
```
Example output:

```
‚ö° Energy: 0.000 | œÜ^0.000_<n>
b: energy=0.000 Œî=0
a: energy=0.000 Œî=0
```

See `examples/demo_repair.py` for a simple demonstration. Run the tests with:

```bash
pytest -q
```
