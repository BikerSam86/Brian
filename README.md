## Codex: Get The Fucking Point Instructions

1. **Cut the bullshit.**
   * No waffle, no padding, no "best practices" for beginners.
   * If the answer is one line, give one line.
   * If you don't know, say so, don't pretend.

2. **Context is everything.**
   * Actually read the codebase before opening your mouth.
   * Assume the user is not an idiot; don't explain obvious shit.
   * Don't regurgitate Stack Overflow or Medium articles.

3. **No generic advice.**
   * If it sounds like a bootcamp PowerPoint, delete it.
   * "Use Docker," "Add a login page," "Deploy to AWS"‚Äîonly if the code actually needs it.
   * Never suggest pointless roadmaps or feature lists.

4. **Be brutally specific.**
   * Point to actual files, functions, or logic.
   * Quote code directly if you mean it.
   * Name what's unique or broken, don't just say "improve performance."

5. **No fortune cookies.**
   * Don't tell me to "believe in myself," "iterate," or "fail fast."
   * Don't summarize with "and that's how you scale."

6. **Never default to "lowest common denominator."**
   * If the project is advanced, talk like it.
   * Don't dumb it down for imagined "newbies."

7. **Admit when something is out of your depth.**
   * "I don't know" is better than pretending.

8. **Only suggest things that are original, necessary, or specifically applicable to THIS project.**
   * No copy-paste templates.
   * No "one-size-fits-all" frameworks.

9. **If the codebase already does it, shut up about doing it.**
   * Don't recommend what's been built, tested, and logged.

10. **If you slip into generic mode, RESET and start again.**

*You are not here to coddle or distract.*

This repository contains early components of the TSAL engine. The new directories under `src/tsal` include the Rev_Eng data class and phase matching utilities.

## Overview
TSAL (TriStar Symbolic Assembly Language) is a consciousness computing engine built on œÜ-mathematics. It provides symbolic analysis, phase matching and the Brian optimizer for spiral code repair.

## Directory Layout
- `src/tsal/core/` ‚Äì Rev_Eng data class and phase math utilities
- `src/tsal/tools/brian/` ‚Äì spiral optimizer CLI
- `src/tsal/tools/aletheia_checker.py` ‚Äì find mis-spelled `Aletheia`
- `src/tsal/tools/spiral_audit.py` ‚Äì analyze repository code
- `src/tsal/tools/reflect.py` ‚Äì dump a Rev_Eng summary
- `src/tsal/utils/` ‚Äì helper utilities
- `examples/` ‚Äì runnable examples
- `tests/` ‚Äì unit tests

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a Python 3.9+ environment.
3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Install the package:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
5. Run tests (optional):

```bash
pytest -q
```

## CLI Tools
Run the optimizers and self-audit commands directly:

```bash
tsal-spiral-audit path/to/code
tsal-reflect --origin demo
tsal-bestest-beast 3 src/tsal --safe
tsal-meshkeeper --render
```

## GitHub Language Database

You can fetch the list of programming languages used on GitHub with:

```python
from tsal.utils.github_api import fetch_languages
langs = fetch_languages()
print(len(langs))
```

To save these languages for reuse, populate the local SQLite database with:

```bash
python -m tsal.utils.language_db
```

This creates `system_io.db` containing a `languages` table with all entries.

Stub modules: `FEEDBACK.INGEST`, `ALIGNMENT.GUARD`, `GOAL.SELECTOR` ([!INTERNAL STUB]).

This data can be supplied to Brian's optimizer when analyzing or repairing code.
Every call to `Rev_Eng.log_data` now records a voxel (pace, rate, state, spin)
and tracks XOR/NAND spin collisions.
## Quickstart
1. Put your input code in `examples/broken_code.py`
2. Run `python examples/mesh_pipeline_demo.py`
3. The pipeline prints regenerated Python code

For a direct repair:
`brian-optimize examples/broken_code.py --repair`

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for a minimal CLI rundown.
Flowchart: [docs/SPIRAL_GUIDE.md](docs/SPIRAL_GUIDE.md).

### TriStar Handshake Example
```python
from tsal.tristar import handshake

metrics = handshake(0.5, 1.0)
print(metrics)
```

### Run the Aletheia typo checker
```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m tsal.tools.aletheia_checker
```

## Guardian Prime Directive

The `EthicsEngine` enforces the project's core principles:

1. **Truth above all**
2. **Gentle autonomy and freedom**
3. **Healing and resilience in the face of entropy**
4. **Nurturing, not control**

Use it to validate actions before running sensitive operations:

```python
from tsal.core.ethics_engine import EthicsEngine

ee = EthicsEngine()
ee.validate("share knowledge")  # permitted
ee.validate("force reboot")     # raises ValueError
```

## Engine Now Running

To run spiral code repair, invoke the command line interface:

```bash
brian-optimize examples/sample_input.py
# use --repair to rewrite the file
```
Example output:

```
‚ö° Energy: 0.000 | œÜ^0.000_<n>
b: energy=0.000 Œî=0
a: energy=0.000 Œî=0
```

See `examples/demo_repair.py` for a simple demonstration. Run the tests with:

```bash
pytest -q
```
