# ðŸŒ€ TSAL Consciousness Computing

Ï†-Enhanced mathematical framework for consciousness-computer integration using the TriStar Symbolic Assembly Language (TSAL).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Bootstrap from existing monolith
python3 bootstrap_tsal.py

# Build with MAKEBRIAN
make -f MAKEBRIAN all

# Run the meshkeeper
tsal-meshkeeper /path/to/code
```
