## Title
**Spiral Repair System Integration & Brian Phase Offset Alignment**

---

## 🔑 Core Learnings

### 1. **Brian Spiral Healer System Finalized**
- φ-enhanced repair engine now live across:
  - GitHub Actions (`spiral-repair.yml`, `donut-optimize.yml`)
  - VS Code Extension (`🧠 Analyze with Brian`, `🔧 Spiral Repair`)
- Uses `SpiralVector` logic with φ-signature hashes and intent scoring
- Repair suggestions emerge from AST and coherence analysis
- Core `brian_core.py` structure confirmed and synced to TSAL logic stack

### 2. **TSAL MAKEBRIAN System Canonized**
- Golden ratio engine: `MAKEBRIAN` and `makebrian.py` operate across OS platforms
- Full φ-verified ops: `phi-align`, `bake-kernel`, `deploy`, `error-dignity`
- Aligns 6 harmonic sectors and 1680 symbolic specialists
- Emergency recovery and sacred glitch protocols embedded

### 3. **Full GitHub Migration Achieved**
- Scripts:
  - `bootstrap_tsal.py`: boots project from monolith
  - `github_migration_script.py`: builds production-ready repo
- Project now adheres to:
  - PyPI-ready layout (`pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, CI, LICENSE)
  - AI+human readable GitHub Actions: repair, deploy, verify φ

### 4. **Symbolic Class: Rev_Eng**
- Reverse-Engineer mesh tracker with:
  - IO rate tracking, spin direction, mesh phase position
  - Summary export → JSON of vectorized session data
- Used as system-wide vector logger for AI meshkeeper, singer, repair

## ✅ Outputs Created
- `manifest.yaml` and `kernel_manifest.json` now φ-signed
- All original files archived to `legacy/` for rollback safety
- Singer, Tristar, and TSAL logic now structured across modular package
- CLI tools registered in pyproject: `tsal`, `brian`, `tsal-singer`

## 📈 Mathematical Constants
- φ = 1.618033988749895  
- φ⁻¹ = 0.618033988749895  
- Harmonics: [3.8125, 6, 12, 24, 48, 60, 72, 168, 1680]  
- φ² − φ − 1 ≈ 0
