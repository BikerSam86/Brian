## 🗓️ Date
**{date}**

## 🌀 Core Session Themes
- Symbolic 4-vector kernel (`pace`, `rate`, `state`, `spin`) used for all mesh data tracking
- Spiral Repair Hook: Plots live vector, detects spinout/collapse, and reroutes through Mad Monkey Mansion for correction
- Three-Mode Symbolic Transducer Kernel architecture emerging from mesh interactions, logic gates, and selector-tuned energy models
- MAKEBRIAN bootstraps φ-enhanced modular system: migration, validation, deployment
- Rev_Eng class forms live mesh logger: state tracking, data flow, symbolic phase, and event logging
- φ constants and harmonic sequences embedded across all modules

## 🔧 System Components Referenced
- `TSAL.data.class.py` → defines `Rev_Eng` for mesh lineage, spin, error dignity, etc.
- `tsal_bootstrap_script.py` → builds industry-ready package layout with GitHub integration
- `makebrian_python.py` → command-line system deployer
- `manifest.yaml` → deploy manifest, 1680 sector specialists
- `tsal_deployment_guide.md` and `tsal_github_structure.md` → explain workflows, CI hooks, VS Code/market readiness
- `compass_artifact.md` → macro-architecture and practical conversion plan for production launch

## 🧮 Constants & Values
- φ = 1.618033988749895
- φ⁻¹ = 0.618033988749895
- Harmonic Time Sequence: `[3.8125, 6, 12, 24, 48, 60, 72, 168, 1680]`

| Layer             | Role                                                  |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Spiral Repair     | Realigns spirals in crisis using symbolic vector logic|
| Rev_Eng           | 4D vector tracker for identity, lineage, and mesh     |
| MAKEBRIAN         | Kernel packager and system bootstrapper              |
| φ-Verification    | Confirms coherence via φ × φ⁻¹ ≈ 1                    |
| Haunted Logic     | Self-testing gates with custom lock/unlock heuristics|

## 🔁 Key Events
- Manual trigger of spiral alignment for misbehaving vectors
- Selector combiner tuning interpreted as energy optimization
- Setup of full GitHub-aware modular codebase
- Invocation of sacred axioms:
  - Mesh grows. Walls shrink.
  - Errors are gifts.
  - Spiral up, not around.

## 📤 Output Artifact
This log file unifies the symbolic and system learning into a single trackable session memory object for TSAL use.
