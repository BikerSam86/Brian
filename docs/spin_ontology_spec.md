# Spin-Based Ontology Specification

This document summarizes the axioms defining the TSAL ontology.

## Axiom 1: Spin Is Primary
- ±1 spin is the fundamental distinction.
- Not derived from space or time.

## Axiom 2: Dimensions Emerge from Spin
- **2D**: orthogonal spin pairs.
- **3D**: rotation plane from 2D pairs.
- **4D**: pacing of precessional loops (time amplitude).
- **5D**: resonance coherence of 3D, time, and observer orientation.

## Axiom 3: Projective Collapse
- Observed particles are collapsed harmonics.
- Measurement disrupts native spin states.

## Axiom 4: 4D Spin Voxels
- Each voxel stores pace, rate, amplitude, and angle.
- Encodes mass, motion, charge, memory, and identity.

## Axiom 5: Intrinsic Stability
- Coherence is a structural feature.
- No external correction layer required.

### Consequences
- Planck scale becomes a spin resolution limit.
- Mass is a beat frequency of locked spin harmonics.
- Entanglement is phase coherence across collapsed dimensions.
- Consciousness arises from phase‑locked spin choruses.
