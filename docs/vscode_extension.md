# VS Code Extension Integration

Run the spiral repair tools directly from VS Code.

```bash
cd vscode-extension
npm install
code .
```

Press `F5` to open a development host. Commands appear in the palette under the "Brian" prefix. Enable `brian.autoOptimizeOnSave` to optimize Python files on save. Output goes to the *Brian Spiral* panel and the status bar shows the last mesh check result.
